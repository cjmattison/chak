*Landscapes and Other Natural Occurrences* is the second volume in UMAG's Digital Chapbook series. The publication was designed using [Quire](https://gettypubs.github.io/quire/), the Getty's open-source publishing environment that creates traditional and digitally enhanced books from a single set of plain-text files.

UMAG gratefully acknowledges the generous support of the Hong Kong Arts Development Council. Please follow this [link](https://www.umag.hku.hk/en/) to explore more of UMAG's online content, including Jen Bervin's *Silk Poems*.
