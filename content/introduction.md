Chak graduated from the Department of Fine Arts at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 1981. At CUHK, Chak studied with the modernist master [Liu Kuo-song](https://www.liukuosung.org/life.php?lang=en), who stressed the importance of considering multiple artistic traditions and unconventional modes of brushwork as a way to transform Chinese painting.

During his undergraduate years, Chak began to incorporate an impressive range of contemporary theories and materials into his work for which he received several prestigious awards, including honours from the Contemporary Hong Kong Art Biennial (Hong Kong Museum of Art, 1979) and Youth Art Now: Asia (Hong Kong Arts Centre, 1980).

After graduation, Chak was awarded a Monbusho Scholarship to continue his studies at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts. He then went on to programs in the United States, completing an MA from Ball State University in 1986, an MFA from Queens College in New York, and residencies at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine, and the National Artists Program at the P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center in New York City. Throughout the 1980s and early ’90s, Chak’s work was shown widely in Hong Kong, New York, Tokyo and Taipei. Having living abroad for nearly 30 years, he returned to Hong Kong in 2009.
