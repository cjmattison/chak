Chakâ€™s exhibition *Landscapes and Other Natural Occurrences* was originally set to open in February 2020, but as with numerous events, the COVID-19 pandemic kept UMAG's doors shut for the first quarter of the year. Formally opening to the public in May 2020, the show is now scheduled to run through 26 July 2020. Work in the exhibition ranges from large two-panel paintings on canvas to a selection of recent ink and watercolour drawings. The accompanying [UMAG publication](https://hkupress.hku.hk/pro/1818.php) collects the majority of Chak's paintings and drawings from 2018 and 2019.

UMAG gratefully acknowledges the Hong Kong Arts Development Council for their support.
