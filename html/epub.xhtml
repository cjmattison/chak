<p>Chak graduated from the Department of Fine Arts at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 1981. At CUHK, Chak studied with the modernist master <a href="https://www.liukuosung.org/life.php?lang=en">Liu Kuo-song</a>, who stressed the importance of considering multiple artistic traditions and unconventional modes of brushwork as a way to transform Chinese painting.</p>

<p>During his undergraduate years, Chak began to incorporate an impressive range of contemporary theories and materials into his work for which he received a number of prestigious awards, including honours from the Contemporary Hong Kong Art Biennial (Hong Kong Museum of Art, 1979) and Youth Art Now: Asia (Hong Kong Arts Centre, 1980).</p>

<p>After graduation, Chak was awarded a Monbusho Scholarship to continue his studies at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts. He then went on to programs in the United States, completing an MA from Ball State University in 1986, an MFA from Queens College in New York, and residencies at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine, and in the National Artists Program at the P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center in New York City. Throughout the 1980s and early ’90s, Chak’s work was shown widely in Hong Kong, New York, Tokyo and Taipei. Having living abroad for nearly 30 years, he returned to Hong Kong in 2009.</p>

        <p>Text in this chapter is selected from an ongoing conversation between Chak and curator Christopher Mattison. Some of the material was published, in slightly different format, in the UMAG catalogue <em>Landscapes and Other Natural Occurrences</em>. Excerpts here focus on Chak’s experimentation with various mediums and types of brushwork, which together form the basis for his concept of ‘Chinese Painting’.</p>
<p>Completed between 2018-19, all of the paintings are oil and acrylic on canvas and the drawings are watercolour, gouache and ink on paper.</p>

<p>Christopher Mattison: <em>Does your choice of materials relate directly to your understanding of being an artist?</em></p>
<p>Chak: The individual brushstrokes are just physical markings that serve as ‘proof’ that I am alive. Sometimes when applying a dab of ultramarine to the canvas, it feels like I'm creating actual air, which might result in me creating a sky over a horizon. The magic of this moment occurs right in front of my eyes, and through a form of actualisation—in this case a single brushstroke—a specific instance is rendered into a frozen sign. It’s really hard for me to say whether the individual brushstrokes, or the broader concepts behind the visual elements, are more or less important to me as an artist. What I do ‘know’ is that I need to paint.</p>

<p><em>One consistent element in your work is a specific form of contemplation; is this something you aspire to create for an audience?</em></p>
<p>To be honest, I've never really considered the audience. Painting for me has never involved an attempt to appease any third party, but instead to target a subject’s essence, to recreate its ‘being’. This is what seems most natural to me. In terms of the actual brushstrokes, within some schools of contemporary art, skill and technique have become subordinate to conceptual gimmicks. Based on his revolutionary feat of manipulating the ‘readymade’ into a form of self-expression, we often forget Duchamp’s foundational years as a highly accomplished Cubist painter. Numerous aspiring artists, influenced by his later innovations, have blindly stepped into the world under the false notion that they can create meaningful work without an appropriate level of craftsmanship.</p>
<p><em>During preparation for the exhibition, you referenced Cubism several times. What is the specific importance of that movement in a work like, say, the</em> Flower-eating Fox <em>?</em></p>























<span id="5-fox-in-dialogue"></span><figure><img src="./site/img/figures/Dialogue/5_Fox.png"><figcaption>

<p>Chak:</p>
<p><em>Could you speak a bit more about your daily process and materials?</em></p>
<p>Chak: I usually get up early, eat breakfast, spend a couple hours reading, go for a walk and then take care of chores. Some days I will spend several hours sketching in the countryside, or else drawing what I see out my studio window. If I’m out somewhere, I’ll take a picture of the scene before I leave, and then head back to my studio. I’m not looking for any inspiration, or thinking about anything in particular when I sketch. If one of the drawings eventually becomes the basis for a painting, it’s then that I’ll consider additional layers of meaning—aesthetic or social. I then work on my paintings in the afternoon light, and in the evening I concentrate on unfinished sketches and setting out a plan for the next day.</p>























<span id="6-chakdrawing-in-dialogue"></span><figure><img src="./site/img/figures/Dialogue/6_Chakdrawing.png"><figcaption>

    

    
        
        
        
    

    
    
    

  </figcaption></figure>












<p>As for materials, over the past year I have been using acrylics to create a type of Chinese ink wash as a hazy background layer. There is an inherent fluidity to acrylics that proves useful when creating this effect. As an art student in the late 1970s, I was intrigued by the wave of Photorealism in the American art scene. In response to this, I spent several years trying to incorporate airbrush work and acrylics into my more traditional oil paints. I gave up on these experiments relatively quickly as I found the acrylics and airbrushed paints expressively lacking, and my heavier brushstrokes often collapsed as they dried.</p>























<span id="7-islet-in-dialogue"></span><figure><img src="./site/img/figures/Dialogue/7_Islet.png"><figcaption>

  </figcaption></figure>












<p><em>Apart from the movement inherent in your paintings, I'm struck by the use of grid lines—rough lines of latitude—that divide some canvases into horizontal planes. This can be seen most clearly in works like</em> Peninsular <em>and</em> Early Spring.</p>
<p>C</p>























<span id="8-peninsular-in-dialogue"></span><figure><img src="./site/img/figures/Dialogue/8_Peninsular.png"><figcaption>

  </figcaption></figure>












<p><em>What is the actual intention of the layer you refer to as a ‘hazy background’, and does this relate to how you sometimes start a painting by building up areas of white?</em></p>
<p>As far as the layers of white, or the blue used for the ocean and sky, one literal interpretation could certainly be related to the natural world surging through Hong Kong, though these swatches of colour are also closely related to the prescribed compositions that are emphasised in Western formalism, as well as the traditional blankness sometimes found in Chinese painting. The whiteness is used to represent another key opposition in my works—‘scattering/gathering’—which is highlighted by the condensed movement of the strokes.</p>























<span id="9-mocking-in-dialogue"></span><figure><img src="./site/img/figures/Dialogue/9_Mocking.png"><figcaption>

  </figcaption></figure>












<p><em>In one of our early conversations you mentioned struggling with getting the acrylic paint to ‘pop’—that it doesn’t shimmer like oil.</em></p>
<p><em>Early Spring</em> is a good example of this. Traditional Chinese painting uses a limited set of inks that are naturally more agile than oils. De Kooning, the master of Abstract Expressionism, used safflower rather than linseed oil because it dries more slowly, allowing him a longer amount of time to work on each canvas. I use water-soluble acrylics in a similar manner to create a splashed-ink effect. I could also add turpentine and linseed to my oils, but I believe the results of those combinations are a bit thin and not nearly as striking.</p>

  </figcaption></figure>












<p><em>For most of your life you have lived in hyper-urban settings—Hong Kong, Tokyo and New York City—but your paintings and drawings are concerned exclusively with layers of the natural world.</em></p>
<p>Within these highly complex urban environments, we face the very modern issue of not always having the physical or mental capacity to adapt to the ever expanding stimuli. We are literally suffocating in concrete and steel. But within the natural world, such turmoil disappears, at least for me. We climb hills to decompress. Trees lean against each other in solidarity and offer shade. One might regard our relationship to nature’s physical elements as unidirectional, but the natural world has its own way of communicating. It embraces humanity and provides us each a space for contemplation. I view the cityscape as a fabricated structure with its own rigorous logic and set of rules, and I am uninterested in such artificial constructs. In opposition to this, the natural world provides me the freedom to explore sensation and human experience through purely visual and ‘natural’ elements—an endless palette of forms, lines, shapes, compositions and hues.</p>

<h4 id="chakhttpjenbervincom-contributors"><a href="http://jenbervin.com/">Chak</a></h4>
