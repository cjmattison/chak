    caption: "A recurring exhibition challenge is knowing how to edit down the final object list. Apart from the artworks and captions, each gallery wall needs a certain amount of space to breathe. We first tried double-hanging the works on paper, and then hanging them in a 3 x 3 grid, but the end result felt congested, so we ultimately opted for a cleaner line. This particular configuration affords equal emphasis to the individual drawings and maintains a more equal balance throughout the gallery."
